# Pyghe - Custom 1090 MHz receiver! 

**Description** 
This is a printed circuit board used to receive 1090MHz signals, decode them, and send them to ForeFlight using the GL90 protocol. "Phyge" features a dual MCU design (ESP32-S3/STM32H7), with the STM32 being responsible for sensors, front-end control, and decoding. The Esp32's primary responsibility is transmitting the decoded data through WiFi to ForeFlight using the GL90 protocol. Additionally, the board features a Ublox M10 GPS, various status LEDs, and a BMP 581.
